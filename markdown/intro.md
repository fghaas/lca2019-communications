Hi, my name is Florian and I’m here to talk to you about
communications in distributed team. I am stepping in for a talk by
XYZ, which unfortunately had to be canceled/rescheduled due to
unforeseen circumstances.

Now, this talk is scheduled for 45 minutes and if my rehearsal timing
is any indication, then I might be filling that time slot completely
and we might not have time for questions in the end. Thus, since the
LCA crowd is normally very active on Twitter, here’s what I’d like you
to do: you see my Twitter handle up there on the screen, so if you
have a question, please blurt it out on Twitter, tag my handle, and
maybe add the `#lca2019` hashtag.


Why am I talking here?

<!-- Note -->
... or rather ...


Why am **I** talking here?

<!-- Note -->

I am turning 40 this year, have been in IT for about 19 years now (18
full-time), and out of that I have worked

* in 4 successive companies, for all of which worked out of offices,
  for 11 years, 

* in a completely distributed company, that I founded, for 6 years,

* and now, for about a year and a half, I run a distributed team that
  is a business unit of a company that has existed for 15 years and
  throughout that time, has only ever worked from a single office.

So I think I might have seen and been aware of some of the rather
interesting challenges that come with this.


This is **not science**.

<!-- Note -->
Nothing of what I am talking about is steeped in any scientific
rigour. I present anecdotes, not evidence. I might be mistaking
correlation for causation, or the other way round. It’s solely based
on my personal experience, and the experience of others I have talked
to, watched, or read. Everything I say here is subject to debate and
rebuttal, or you can simply have a different opinion.

But it’s definitely **not** science.
