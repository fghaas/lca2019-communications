Communications for distributed teams

Why am I talking here?

<!-- Note -->
I am turning 40 this year, have been in IT for about 20 years now, and
out of that I have worked

* in 4 successive companies, for all of which worked out of offices,
  for 11 years, 

* in a completely distributed company, that I founded, for 6 years,

* and now, for about a year and a half, I run a distributed team that
  is a business unit of a company that has existed for 15 years and
  throughout that time, has only ever worked from a single office.

So I think I might have seen and been aware of some of the rather
interesting challenges that come with this.


This is **not science**.

<!-- Note -->
Nothing of what I am talking about is steeped in any scientific
rigour. I present anecdotes, not evidence. I might be mistaking
correlation for causation, or the other way round. It’s solely based
on my personal experience, and the experience of others I have talked
to, watched, or read. Everything I say here is subject to debate and
rebuttal, or you can simply have a different opinion.

But it’s definitely **not** science.
