A distributed team is a professional group whose members **do not rely
on physical proximity** in order to **routinely collaborate
productively.**


Being productive in a distributed team is a skill that most people
must **learn;** it is not innate to us.


**Nothing** has as dire an impact on productivity as **poor
communications.**


Working in a distributed team means **working asynchronously.**


A distributed team must **habitually externalise** information.

The only reason to use chat and video for collaboration is a need for
immediate, interactive mutual feedback.
