A distributed team is a professional group whose members **do not rely
on physical proximity** in order to **routinely collaborate
productively.**


Being productive in a distributed team is a skill that most people
must **learn;** it is not innate to us.


**Nothing** has as dire an impact on productivity as **poor
communications.**


Working in a distributed team means **working asynchronously.**


A distributed team must **habitually externalise** information.

The only reason to use chat for collaboration is a need for immediate,
interactive mutual feedback.


The only reason to use video calls is to be able to pick up on
nontextual and nonverbal cues.


Every video call needs an agenda.


Until machines get intelligent enough to automatically transcribe and
summarise words spoken in a meeting, **write notes and a summary of
every meeting you attend,** and **circulate them.**

<!-- Note -->
If you think that video calls are any less work than chat meetings or
a shared document that’s being edited together or dicussed in
comments, think again. The only way a video call is less work, is when
everyone’s lazy and the call is, therefore, useless. Every meeting
needs notes and a summary, and you need to circulate these notes not
only with everyone who attended the meeting, but with everyone who has
a need-to-know.


1. Meeting title
2. Date, time, attendees
3. Summary
4. Discussion points (tabular)
5. Action items

<!-- Note -->

Putting an executive summary at the very top is extraordinarily
helpful so people can decide if they

* should familiarise themselves with what was discussed, immediately,
  and possibly respond if they have objections, or
* only want to be aware of what was decided, or
* just keep in the back of their head that a meeting happened, that
  notes exist, and where they can find them when they need to refer
  back to them.


Whenever you need to thoroughly **brief a group of people on an
important subject,** consider using a **5-paragraph format.**


1. Situation
2. Mission
3. Execution
4. Logistics
5. Command and Signal

<!-- Note -->
This is a format as it is being used by many armed forces; in NATO
parlance it’s called the 5-paragraph field order. Now I’m generally
not a fan of applying military thinking to civilian life — after all
we shouldn’t forget that the military is an institution that kills
people and breaks things, and I say that as a commissioned officer in
my own country’s army —, but in this case it’s actually something that
can very much be applied to professional communications, with some
rather minor modifications. 


1. Situation
2. Objective
3. Plan
4. Logistics
5. Communications

<!-- Note -->

1. Situation is about what position we’re in, and **why** we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.
2. Objective is **what** we want to achieve.
3. Plan is **how** we want to achieve it.
4. Logistics is about what budget and resources are avaiable, and how
   they are used.
5. Communications is about how you’ll be coordinating among yourselves
   and with others in order to achieve your goal.


“Please come back to me with your questions by 1500 UTC tomorrow” is
far superior to “are there any questions?”


The amount of incoming information in a distributed team can be
daunting.


Consider using the “four-D” approach when dealing with incoming
information.

(Hat tip to David Allen)


* Drop
* Delegate
* Defer
* Do

<!-- Note -->
* **Drop** means read, understand, and then archive. It’s what you use
  for anything that doesn’t require any action on your part.
* **Delegate** is for things that do require action, but not from
  you. Make sure that it gets to the right person and is understood by
  *them*, and make a note for follow-up.
* **Defer** means it needs doing, and it’s you who needs to do it, but
  it doesn’t need doing *immediately*. Enter it into your task list
  (to use a very generic term, more on this in a bit), and clear it
  from your inbox.
* **Do** are the (typically very few) things that remain that need to
  be done *by you, and immediately.*

Following this approach does not mean that you’ll never be overwhelmed
by the amount of information that you need to process. But it’ll
greatly reduce that risk.
